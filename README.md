## Description
GitHired is a candidate search application that leverages the GitHub API to help employers discover top candidates for hiring. With a streamlined interface, users can review candidate profiles, save promising candidates to a list, and easily view essential details like name, username, location, and GitHub link. Built with TypeScript and React, GitHired simplifies the candidate search process and is deployed on Render for easy access.
